**About the project**

This programme was built to model the evolution of a pollutant concentration in a river using the advection equation ∂𝜃/∂𝑡 = -U ∂𝜃/∂𝑥 for 5 test cases

We used the coding langauage python and our code was built through integrating Google Colab to Github repositories

**Getting started**

As our code was built through colab you simply require a Google account to access and run this code

**Installation**

To successfully run this programme use the following steps: first login to Colab using a browser,
then clone the repo

**Usage**
